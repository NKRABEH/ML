# AML
This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks for the [Algorithmic Machine Learning](http://www.eurecom.fr/en/course/AML-2020Spring) course realised during spring semester 2019 at [Eurecom](http://www.eurecom.fr/en).


### Themes covered by the notebooks: 
#### -Recommandation systems
building a music recommender system.
key words : statistical models, pyspark.
#### -Anomaly detection in IT systems
building an anomaly detection for IT systems
Key words : interpretable models, Deep Learning, multi, sklearn.
#### - Housing pricing
Predicting prices on the US property market (kaggle challenge).
Key words : regression problem, seaborn, sklearn. 


### Notebook's structure 
Each notebook is structured in such a way that explore the 3 following tasks:
#### - Data Exploration & Pre-processing: 
Familiarisation with the data. This includes : Data visualisation, descriptive statistics, correlation etc .. 
Pre-processing consist in identifying and dealing with eventual errors in the dataset. This includes: Removing outliers, Normalising and standardising, Handling missing information in the dataset etc 
#### - Model Selection & Parameter Optimisation:
Here we try out and compare possible candidate models. 
Different techniques are used for the parameters tunings. This includes: cross-validation, Bayesian optimisation etc .. 
#### - Model Evaluation:
Evaluation of the models used, and results interpretation and comments.
