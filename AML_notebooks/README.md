# AML
This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks for the [Algorithmic Machine Learning](http://www.eurecom.fr/en/course/AML-2020Spring) course realised during spring semester 2019 at [Eurecom](http://www.eurecom.fr/en).

Each notebook is structured in such a way that explore the 3 following tasks:
#### - Data Exploration & Pre-processing: 
Familiarisation with the data. This includes : Data visualisation, descriptive statistics, correlation etc .. 
Pre-processing consist in identifying and dealing with eventual errors in the dataset. This includes: Removing outliers, Normalising and standardising, Handling missing information in the dataset etc 
#### - Model Selection & Parameter Optimisation:
Here we try out and compare possible candidate models. 
Different techniques are used for the parameters tunings. This includes: cross-validation, Bayesian optimisation etc .. 
#### - Model Evaluation:
Evaluation of the models used, and results interpretation and comments.
